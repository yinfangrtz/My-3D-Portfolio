### Welcome
Welcome to [My 3D Portfolio](https://my-3d-portfolio-full.netlify.app)! Feel free to explore my website!

### Overview
The "My 3D Portfolio" website is crafted using a blend of contemporary web technologies, providing an immersive and interactive platform to showcase my academic achievements, professional experiences, and front-end development projects. The following technologies have been harnessed in the creation of this website:

React: The architecture of the website is expertly constructed using React components, offering a modular and reusable approach to shaping the user interface. The use of Higher Order Components (HOCs) enhances and manages component behavior.  
Three.js: The visual experience is enriched by the integration of the Three.js library, infusing captivating 3D graphics and animations that engage visitors in a distinctive and captivating manner.  
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The core trio of web development is seamlessly intertwined to create a cohesive and dynamic user experience. HTML structures the content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivity.  
Tailwind CSS: The design aesthetic is polished and the responsiveness is ensured through the implementation of the Tailwind CSS framework, which streamlines the styling process.  
Framer Motion: To add an extra layer of visual appeal and dynamism, the Framer Motion library is employed, enabling fluid animations and delightful transitions.
